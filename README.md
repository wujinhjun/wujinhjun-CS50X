# wujinhjun's CS50 assignment

Because I can't commit my code to the [me50/wujinhjun](https://github.com/me50/wujinhjun/tree/main) via git, I have to commit them to my repository as a learning record for me;
As the same time, this course does not seem to strictly prohibit open source, so maybe my actions don't break the rules

[Week0: This is the assignment 1](./first-homework/): a simple mini-game by the scratch
