# CS50X assignment in 2022

This is an open source course in the [edx](https://www.edx.org/) by Harvard
Can enroll by this link [CS50X)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/)

***

Because I can't commit my code to the [me50/wujinhjun](https://github.com/me50/wujinhjun/tree/main) via git, I have to commit them to my repository as a learning record for me;
As the same time, this course does not seem to strictly prohibit open source, so maybe my actions don't break the rules

It's a bit of pity that as of now, I haven't finished every assignment. Because I haven't had time to do the final project. According to the requirements of the course, my idea is to make a simple markdown editing software, maybe with the function of cloud synchronization. Hope for a good performance.

[This is final project](https://github.com/wujinhjun/markdown-editor): A simple markdown editor.

Also, I'd like to say that I have registered for the cs50W course, and I will also put my project code on the github, which is [the repository address](https://github.com/wujinhjun/wujinhjun-CS50W).
